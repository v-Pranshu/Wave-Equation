# Wave-Equation

This code plots the solution in the form of contours of a given wave equation whose initial
conditions are as given in the problem statement.

It also plots how the wave will propogate with time, the dashed lines in
this plot represent the left and right running waves, and the solution wave
is the average of both these waves.
